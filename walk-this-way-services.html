<p id='slogan'> Walking Marins Happiest
  <br> Dogs Since 2001
  <h1 id='services'>Services</h1>
<div id='scribbleWords'>
  <p id='pOne'> We offer exercise and socialization for your
    <br>best friend.  Our group hikes give your dog a
    <br>chance to explore the outdoors with a pack of
    <br>furry friends.  Your dog will be picked up for
    <br>a fun, group hike in the hills of Marin and
    <br>returned to you after the walk.  We understand
    <br>that each dog is differeent and are happy to meet
    <br>whatever needs you and your pet may have.

    <p id='pTwo'>Our services include group hikes, individual walks
    <br>and pet sitting.

    <p id='pThree'>Group Walks
    <p>Group walks introduce your dog to a social
    <br>environment where he or she can interact and make
    <br>friends with other dogs. Being part of a pack
    <br>stimulates your dog mentally and teaches him or her
    <br>dog etiquette.  Give your best friend a chance
    <br>to make new friends by sending him or her on daily
    <br>group walks!  Group walks last one hour.

    <p id='pFour'>Individual Walks
    <p>Individual walks give your dog a chance for some
    <br>one-on-one time with our Walk This Way dog walkers.
    <br>Great for puppies, older dogs or dogs with special
    <br>needs, the Individual Walk is a great way to give
    <br>your dog lots of TLC.  Individual walks last 25 mins.

    <p id='pFive'> Pet Sitting: Your Home
    <p>This allows your dog to stay in the comfort of his
    <br>or her own home and still receive love and care while
    <br>you're away. Pet Sitting includes morning and evening
    <br>walks, food, water, any medications necessary,
    <br>picking up mail, watering plants and, of course,
    <br>lots of TLC.

    <p id='pSix'> Pet Sitting: Our Home
    <p>If you would prefer, we can take care of your dog
    <br>overnight at our house. Your dog will be cared for
    <br>completely with lots of love, two walks a day, and we
    <br>care of any special needs.
